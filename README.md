This portfolio was created using a Bootstrap template. The color scheme was chosen based on my favorite color blue. I ended up choosing a darker shade of blue along with gray text to try to match some of my projects which tend to have darker themes.

Many of these projects being presented are from the New Maps Program through the University of Kentucky. Thanks to my instructors for all of their help and feedback throughout the course of this certificate program. I also wanted to give a shoutout for all the classmates who helped me (and gave me feedback) throughout my time working on this Graduate Certificate, especially Michael Sparks for all his help during the spring semester.


# Projects

## Final Project

For my final project, I created a map highlighting research projects in the Steve Price Herpetology Lab in the Forestry and Natural Resources Department at the University of Kentucky. I'm currently a Research Analyst in this lab and work on several of these projects. I used data from the Price lab webpage (https://pricelab.ca.uky.edu/research-topics-and-current-projects; https://pricelab.ca.uky.edu/publications) to create a dot map of the recent research projects through Kentucky and surrounding states. This repository can be accessed here: https://github.com/jnewman747/HerpetologyLab

This map was created using Leaflet.


## Wildlfires in Alaska

Using wildfire data from the USDA (https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2013-0009.6), we created a static hexbin heatmap showing the total number of wildfires in our selected state (mine being Alaska) from 1992-2020.

This map was created by QGIS, spatial joins, and hexbins.


## Natural Landforms in Alaska

This map examined topography and natural landforms in Alaska. We used GDAL and QGIS to convert raster elevation units (https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program) to create contours. Then we used Mapbox to create a map using an arch (https://www.usgs.gov/us-board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data) in our selected state (mine being Alaska).

This map was created using GDAL, QGIS, and Mapbox.


## Predicted Habitat

This is a static map from my M.S. work at Clemson University involving effects of climate chnage on green salamanders. We collected salamanders in the field and brought them back to Clemson for a laboratory experiment. All work was done conducted under proper permitting. We determined water loss rates using a flow through machine and we used the results to create a hybrid model (correlative + mechanistic model) to predict potential refugia under different climatic scenarios and retraints. More information about this project and map can be found here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361109903_Integrating_physiology_into_correlative_models_can_alter_projections_of_habitat_suitability_under_climate_change_for_a_threatened_amphibian

This map was created using ArcGIS and MaxEnt.


## United States Energy Sources

This interactive map highlights three different renewable energy sources found in the United States: hydro, wind, and solar. Click on the individual dots to learn more about individual power plants and their generating capacity. Use the legend to toggle on and off the different energy layers. The data for this map was collected from here: http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/

This map was created using Leaflet.


## Taco Tuesday

This interactive map may not seem relevant to the natural resources theme at first, but it does serve an important purpose! Wildlife biologists need to eat too, and what better bonding tool is there than food? Introverts, like myself, run out of things to talk about while in the field and so often times, the topic of "food" becomes an easy target. After a long day in the field, it has become an excellent (and tasty!) tradition to find the best eateries in town with my field crews.
